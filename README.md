# TypeScript Style Guide Skill

This repository contains a TypeScript style guide packaged as a skill for AI coding agents. The goal is to give agents concrete, opinionated defaults for writing idiomatic TypeScript in the project owner's preferred style.

The repository is currently an infrastructure skeleton: the research, decision register, outline, and policy pages have not been written yet.

The packaged skill shape is `SKILL.md` as the root router, focused policy pages under `guidelines/`, and procedure pages under `workflows/`. Planning files remain in the repo as source material, but ordinary skill use should load only the router and relevant guidelines or workflows.

## Start Here

- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md): skill entrypoint and root router for progressive disclosure.
- [guidelines.md](guidelines.md): guideline index for the packaged skill.
- [guidelines/](guidelines): focused TypeScript style policy pages.
- [workflows/](workflows): procedural workflows for larger tasks.
- [OUTLINE.md](OUTLINE.md): the guideline map used to draft the guide.
- [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md): style decision register.
- [DRAFTING.md](DRAFTING.md): drafting order, page rules, and scope rules.
- [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md): the required format for each guideline page.
- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): repository instructions for AI coding agents.

## Research

Source research reports go in [.ai/research/](.ai/research). They are used to synthesize the outline and decision register. Treat them as background material, not as final policy.

## Intended Style

Not yet decided. Summarize the guide's overall posture here (a short bullet list) once the decision register in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) is resolved.

## Workflow

1. Update [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) when policy changes.
2. Update the relevant page under [guidelines/](guidelines) or [workflows/](workflows).
3. Keep [guidelines.md](guidelines.md) linked to every packaged guideline page.
4. Keep [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) small and route through progressive disclosure.
5. Run `bash checks/check.sh` before committing skill changes.
6. Use [DRAFTING.md](DRAFTING.md) and [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) only when adding or reshaping pages.

## mdBook

The guide can be built as an mdBook for browsing:

```sh
mdbook build
mdbook serve --open
```

Book source lives under [src/](src). The book source uses symlinks to expose packaged skill files without duplicating the canonical copies at the repository root, and a preprocessor strips SKILL.md's frontmatter from the rendered book.

GitHub Pages deployment is handled by [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml). For first-time setup, set the repository's Pages source to "GitHub Actions" under Settings > Pages. Pushes to `main` will build the book and deploy the generated `book/` output.

## Packaging Model

The skill uses progressive disclosure:

- `SKILL.md` stays small and routes tasks to relevant guidelines and workflows.
- `guidelines.md` indexes the available guideline pages.
- Focused policy pages live under `guidelines/`.
- Procedural pages live under `workflows/`.
- Planning files like `README.md`, `OUTLINE.md`, `DRAFTING.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `.ai/research/` stay outside the packaged skill unless explicitly needed.
